  Hi, I'm Arian, a junior data scientist. I am mainly interested in utilizing data science to address business problems. I have worked on various machine learning problems, and I'm experienced with essential machine learning tools such as TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, and Scikit-Learn.

          This project, which led to a couple of publications, was my master's thesis project. I have deployed a couple of DRL algorithms such as A2C and PPO to address the caching problem in IoT networks where files have a limited lifetime. We improved the cache hit rate and energy consumption of the network significantly.

            Aside from the thesis project (mentioned above), I was the teaching assistant for multiple courses. I helped students to develop and debug Android applications using Java and XML for one semester. I also taught MATLAB programming and helped students with code debugging for another class.

            Before starting the M.Sc program, I had a research contract with my supervisor, Dr. Ping Wang. Since she hadn't had any grad student at York University until then, we needed to develop a research road map for the team she was recruiting at the time. We find credible resources to study DRL. After doing an extensive literature review, we found a couple of interesting problems that we thought DRL could effectively address, such as caching in computer networks and routing in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) networks. We also briefly studied federated learning and its use cases, which later became the research area for our other group members.

          During the M.Sc program, I  focused my studies on machine learning and data science. I took courses on machine learning theory, data mining, advance deep neural network, data visualization, and more. My thesis is about the application of Deep Reinforcement Learning in IoT networks.

          This program helped me to distance my studies from electrical engineering and pivot towards computer science. I took courses in bio-inspired artificial intelligence and statistical learning, which got me hooked on machine learning readings for the years to come.

          I received my bachelor's degree from the University of Guilan, in the beautiful city of Rasht, Iran.  I did some TAship for electronics courses. For my final project, I designed an LED lamp driver and developed an android application to control the lamp's brightness.

    content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
      Alongside my interests in data science and machine learning, I often find myself busy with one of the followings in my free time:
      - Doing some small investments and following business news (I love this one!)
      - Gaming
      - Binge-watching Netflix
      - Binge-listening a podcast

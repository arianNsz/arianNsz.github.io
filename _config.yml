  I'm a Machine Learning Engineer with a strong foundation in predictive modeling, ML system design, and cloud-native AI development. Over the last few years, I’ve built and deployed real-time ML systems in production, led GenAI automation initiatives, and developed time-series models that directly influenced strategic decisions — all while championing best practices in MLOps and model governance.

  Currently, I lead ML efforts at Northbridge Financial, where I:
  * Deployed XGBoost and forecasting models that reduced underwriting loss and secured resource expansion ($1M+ impact).
  * Designed and productionized a GPT-powered automation pipeline for insurance claims processing.
  * Built CI/CD pipelines with drift monitoring and automated retraining using Azure, Docker, and Hyperopt.

  
  I enjoy bridging the gap between experimentation and reliable deployment — especially when working on applied NLP, LLMs, and decision intelligence systems. My recent work includes building scalable FastAPI services integrated with OpenAI, LangChain, and Pydantic, as well as designing high-throughput asynchronous systems optimized for Azure OpenAI’s token limits.
  
  I've also published peer-reviewed research in Deep Reinforcement Learning for IoT networks and am passionate about exploring how modern ML intersects with real-world systems.

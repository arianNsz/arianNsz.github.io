  Hi! I'm Arian, and I'm obsessed with turning complex data into awesome machine learning solutions. With four years of experience in finance and advertising under my belt, I've got a knack for building predictive models, wrangling data pipelines, and playing with the latest LLM magic. From my earlier adventures in IoT and deep reinforcement learning research to real-world projects in risk management, productivity tools, and ad targeting, I love the challenge of bringing ML ideas to life. Want to see what I've been up to? Check out my portfolio, Medium articles, or LinkedIn profile.
  
  If you're building cool stuff with data, let's connect - you can find me on LinkedIn or shoot me an email at a.nasehzade@gmail.com!
  
  Cheers!

  #         This project, which led to a couple of publications, was my master's thesis project. I have deployed a couple of DRL algorithms such as A2C and PPO to address the caching problem in IoT networks where files have a limited lifetime. We improved the cache hit rate and energy consumption of the network significantly.

          At North Bridge, I've tackled a couple of big projects and a few smaller ones in between. I led the revamp of our Auto Insurance Risk Management system using XGBoost models to predict vehicle losses, which saves us over $1M a year. I also got our Smart Staffing models to predict workloads, helping us move our staff efficiently—think big savings in time and money!
          On the side, I've played around with everything from building a monitoring module for another model, to crafting an email parser, and even piecing together a proof of concept for a really cool LLM RAG-based project. Although we didn't move forward with the LLM due to its complexity in production, it was a great dive into what's possible.
          
          Working here has not only sharpened my model-building skills but also deepened my experience with the Azure cloud platform. I've had the chance to develop everything from data pipelines for fetching, transforming, and storing data, to setting up scheduled batch scoring jobs on the Azure ML platform. It's been a fantastic playground for applying and expanding my data science toolkit!

          At Docma, I dove into the world of data-driven advertising, focusing mainly on backend stuff like developing endpoints to help refine targeted ad campaigns. My role was a mix of coding and problem-solving—I developed and tested various metrics, enhanced the execution speeds of our audience profiling algorithms, and even restructured our code repository to better support our data products.
          
          I also spent a good chunk of time debugging and designing experiments to ensure our profiling algorithms stayed sharp across different population segments. It was all about making sure our data tools were not only fast but also reliable and precise.

          At TicTie Labs, I focused on blending agriculture with AI to make indoor farming smarter. I developed a predictive app using machine learning to estimate product yields under various environmental conditions—this helped our farm operators align production closely with customer demands.

          I also created environment monitoring dashboards, integrating Python, SQL, and Microsoft PowerBi to provide real-time reports on critical farm conditions like temperature, ensuring operators were alerted to any out-of-range parameters. Plus, I spearheaded the development of an Android app prototype designed to streamline data capture for farmers, fitting seamlessly into their daily routines without any fuss.

          Fresh from completing my M.Sc. at York University, I co-founded ETF Ocean to democratize algorithmic investment strategies. Our startup aimed to bridge the gap between complex investment models and everyday investors. In this role, I developed and implemented portfolio selection systems using Python, leveraging both technical and fundamental financial indicators. I also crafted python programs to verify portfolio back-tests' results and designed ETL pipelines to handle large-scale historical financial data accurately.
          
          On the database side, I managed a PostgreSQL database and a BigQuery data warehouse on Google Cloud Platform. I was also deeply involved in shaping our business model and spearheading our initial marketing campaigns.

          This program helped me to distance my studies from electrical engineering and pivot towards computer science. I took courses in bio-inspired artificial intelligence and statistical learning, which got me hooked on machine learning readings for the years to come.

          I received my bachelor's degree from the University of Guilan, in the beautiful city of Rasht, Iran.  I did some TAship for electronics courses. For my final project, I designed an LED lamp driver and developed an android application to control the lamp's brightness.

    content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
      Alongside my interests in data science and machine learning, I often find myself busy with one of the followings in my free time:
      - Doing some small investments and following business news (I love this one!)
      - Gaming
      - Binge-watching Netflix
      - Binge-listening a podcast

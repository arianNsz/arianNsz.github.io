          This project, which led to a couple of publications, was my thesis topic during the M.Sc studies. I have deployed a couple of DRL algorithms such as A2C and PPO to address the caching problem in IoT networks where files have a limited lifetime. We improved the cache hit rate and energy consumption of the network significantly.

            Every company needs its networks properly administered and The Boring Compay is no exception. Digging holes is hard and I play my part making sure the whole company stays connected. I lead a team of 5 people and enjoy driving the company to try new technologies.

          During my time at Harvard I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

          I spent a lot of my free time as a committee member of the *Harvard Mountaineering Club* taking on roles such as *Trip Secretary* and *Vice-President*.

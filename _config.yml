  Hi, I'm Arian, a junior data scientist. I am mainly interested in utilizing data science to address business problems. I have worked on various machine learning problems, and I'm experienced with essential machine learning tools such as TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, and Scikit-Learn.

          This project, which led to a couple of publications, was my thesis topic during the M.Sc studies. I have deployed a couple of DRL algorithms such as A2C and PPO to address the caching problem in IoT networks where files have a limited lifetime. We improved the cache hit rate and energy consumption of the network significantly.

            Every company needs its networks properly administered and The Boring Compay is no exception. Digging holes is hard and I play my part making sure the whole company stays connected. I lead a team of 5 people and enjoy driving the company to try new technologies.

            Before starting the M.Sc program, I had a research contract with my supervisor, Dr. Ping Wang. Since she hadn't had any grad student at York University until then, we needed to develop a research road map for the team she was recruiting at the time. We find credible resources to study DRL. After doing an extensive literature review, we found a couple of interesting problems that we thought DRL could effectively address, such as caching in computer networks and routing in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) networks. We also briefly studied federated learning and its use cases, which later became the research area for other group members.

          During the M.Sc program, I  focused my studies on machine learning and data science. I took courses on machine learning theory, data mining, advance deep neural network, data visualization, and more. My thesis is about the application of Deep Reinforcement Learning in IoT networks.

          During my time at Harvard I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

          I spent a lot of my free time as a committee member of the *Harvard Mountaineering Club* taking on roles such as *Trip Secretary* and *Vice-President*.

  I'm a Machine Learning Engineer with a strong foundation in predictive modeling, ML system design, and cloud-native AI development. Over the last few years, I’ve built and deployed real-time ML systems in production, led GenAI automation initiatives, and developed time-series models that directly influenced strategic decisions — all while championing best practices in MLOps and model governance.

  Currently, I lead ML efforts at Northbridge Financial, where I:
  * Deployed XGBoost and forecasting models that reduced underwriting loss and secured resource expansion ($1M+ impact).
  * Designed and productionized a GPT-powered automation pipeline for insurance claims processing.
  * Built CI/CD pipelines with drift monitoring and automated retraining using Azure, Docker, and Hyperopt.

  
  I enjoy bridging the gap between experimentation and reliable deployment — especially when working on applied NLP, LLMs, and decision intelligence systems. My recent work includes building scalable FastAPI services integrated with OpenAI, LangChain, and Pydantic, as well as designing high-throughput asynchronous systems optimized for Azure OpenAI’s token limits.
  
  I've also published peer-reviewed research in Deep Reinforcement Learning for IoT networks and am passionate about exploring how modern ML intersects with real-world systems.

          A demo web app that leverages large language models to screen resumes against job descriptions and provide recruiter-style recommendations.
          * Problem: Traditional resume screening is manual, slow, and inconsistent.
          * Solution: Built a scalable app that takes in a resume and job description, uses OpenAI GPT to analyze alignment, and returns a recommendation with rationale.
          * Tech Stack: Streamlit, LangChain, OpenAI GPT-3.5, Pydantic, Document Comparison, GitHub-based deployment

          * Developed a XGBoost model to predict loan approval based on customer data.
          * Created a Streamlit app to allow users to input their data and interact with the model.
          * Containerized the app using Docker.
          * Deployed the app on Heroku cloud platform (deployment through container registry).
          * Pydantic was used for data validation and FastAPI for the backend.

          * Working alongside experienced developers taught me a lot about how to think and design products.
          * Managing stakeholders, communicating, and securing their approvals was also a significant part of my job, which was new to me.
          * From a technical perspective, I got to work with many new technologies and tools, mostly on the Azure cloud platform.
          * I had the chance to develop ETL and inference pipelines on the Azure Machine Learning platform, create LLM-based applications, and a lot of other cool stuff.

          * At Docma, I primarily focused on backend development, creating endpoints to enhance targeted advertising campaigns.
          * Beyond coding, I helped the team refine their code repository for better long-term maintenance and easier onboarding of new members.
          * I also dedicated significant time to debugging and designing experiments, ensuring our profiling algorithms were effective across different population segments. The goal was to maintain our data tools' speed, reliability, and precision.

          * I had never imagined that my first official job would be at the intersection of technology and indoor farming!
          * At TicTie Labs, I developed a machine learning model to predict plant growth, aiding operators in meeting their demand efficiently.
          * Additionally, I created dashboards to visualize live monitoring data from the farms and alert operators about conditions that were out of range.
          * I also proposed and developed an Android application to help operators capture data seamlessly without disrupting their workflow.

    content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
      * I love watching dog videos! Cats are fine too. :D
      * I enjoy playing video games from time to time, especially FIFA during short breaks.
      * I'm a bit too much into coffee! I love exploring new coffee shops and experimenting with different brewing methods.
      * I currently live in downtown Toronto and enjoy long walks on sunny days.
      * I'm not a fan of camping. I often joke about why we'd sleep in the woods when our ancestors worked so hard to build cities and houses! :D
